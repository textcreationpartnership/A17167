1. ¶The summe of the Romish Bull published against the most vertuous Queene of England, and the whole noble Realme of England.

    _ ¶That the foresayd vnmeasurable power of the Romish Bishop, is not proued by these wordes of the Lord vnto Peter: Peter louest thou me? feede my sheepe.

    _ That the Bishoppes fauourers, neither by these wordes of Christ, I haue prayed for thee Peter: nor yet by these wordes, Behold here be two swordes: can sufficiently proue, that that power is geuen them which they vaunt of.

    _ Here are expounded these wordes of our Sauiour, Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke, &c. and it is shewed that in thē there is nothyng spoken of the Popes fulnesse of power: & that the church of Christ is not builded vpon Peter or the Pope.

    _ ¶That not euen by the gift of the keyes vnto Peter, there is any fulnesse of power deliuered by the Lord, either vnto Peter, or vnto the Pope, for that the keyes are a farre other thing, yea and a thing of much greater holinesse then is the sayd fulnesse of the popish power.

    _ ¶What is ment in the Gospell by loosing and binding: and how Christes Apostles did loose and binde.

    _ ¶ Here is expounded the mysterie of the Armes & cognisances of the Romane Bishops bearing brauely in their scutchions a triple crowne with a payre of Keyes.

    _ ¶Of the wordes, power, and ministery, and so is the disputation of the keyes knit vp.

    _ ¶Here is expounded that place of Ieremy, I haue set thee ouer kynges & kingdomes &c. and it is shewed how the same maketh nothyng to the proofe of the Byshop of Romes tyranny which he exerciseth agaynst kynges and kyngdomes.

    _ ¶That the Bishop of Romes vsurpyng of supremacie ouer kynges and nacions, is agaynst the open example and expresse commaundemēt of our Lord Christ.

    _ ¶Nor that the Apostles of Christ tooke vppon them any souereintie in Christes Church, but onely the ministerie.

    _ ¶That the first Bishops of Rome vsurped not any souereintie at all in the church, but were lowly shepeheardes, teachers and ministers of the Church of Rome: yea and besides that, also Martyrs of Christ.

    _ ¶That the Decretall Epistles of the first Byshops of Rome are but counterfettes.

    _ ¶Also that the latter Byshops of Rome vntill Gregorie the first, vaunted not of any fulnesse of power, nor of their supremacie ouer beyng aduaunced aboue kinges and kingdomes.

    _ ¶That the latter Byshops of Rome degenerated vtterly from the first and middlemost Byshoppes of Rome, and that they vsurpe the cursed title of full power, agaynst all right and reason.

    _ ¶This discourse is concluded, and here is shewed that the sentence of Pope Pius the fifth published against the most vertuous Queene of England, and all her whole noble Realme, is vtterly fond and of none effect.

    _ ¶Here are perused the articles as well of the accusation as also of the slaunders alleadged by the Byshop of Rome in his Bull agaynst the most vertuous Queene of England.

    _ ¶That it is no monstruousnesse at all for the Queene of England to be called supreme head of the Realme of England vpon earth.

    _ ¶How it is no monstruousnesse for the Queene of England and consequently for all ciuill Magistrates to determine in cases Ecclesiasticall, or to vndertake and beare the charge of Church matters, as to depose euill Byshops, and to set vp better in their roomes.

    _ ¶That the Queene of England hath not chosen mens opinions for herself, and hir realme to follow, but Gods pure word, hertofore sought out, and receyued by King Edward the sixth: nor yet sette foorth bookes of heresie, or forced her realme to receiue them.

    _ ¶ Here be recited other articles of accusation, which the Bull mentioneth concerning the Queenes abolishing of the masse, and hir taking away of many other superstitions and abuses. Also here is expounded, what catholikenesse is, and who be catholike.

    _ ¶The Queene of England hath iustly cōmaunded her subiectes that they should not acknowledge the Church of Rome, or obey the lawes therof. Iustly also hath she bound them by othe to abiure the authoritie and obedience of the Romish Byshop.

    _ ¶That Kynges and Magistrates ought to compell their subiectes vnto goodnesse, and not suffer euery man to make his own choyse in folowing what seemeth best to him selfe.

    _ ¶That Kinges and Magistrates doe lawfully punish, yea and also put to death such as breake the true religiō, and disobey holy lawes. And so this discourse is shet vp.

    _ ¶That the Queene of England is not an hereticke, and therefore not stricken with the popes curse, nor cut of from the vnitie of Christes bodie.

    _ ¶That the Pope of Rome doth falsly and tyrannously giue sentence that the Queene of England is depriued of her kingdome and of all right of her crowne.

    _ ¶That the Byshop of Rome can not discharge them of their othe which are sworne to the Queene For the trothe that is once plighted must be kept both to good and bad.

    _ ¶ That the Nobilitie and Commons of England must not obey the popes commaundement, nor feare his curse. And here is shewed what thing subiectes owe to theyr Princes, by Gods appoyntment, and how greuously God hath alwayes punished rebelles and sedicious persons.

    _ ¶How great calamities and how great mischieues the Bishop of Rome hath brought vpō kyngdomes and nations in Christendome these foure hundred, yeares and more, in putting downe kinges, and remouyng kingdomes, and discharging subiectes of theyr dew fealtie and allegeance, by the fulnesse of their power, a brief historicall declaration or wyndyng vp.
